2D platformer made with PyGame

This game was made as a project for my first progrmming course.
It was made by me and my friend as a 2 person project. The artwork is also all made by my friend.

The code is a little messy, but I am proud of what we made since we had to learn OOP and PyGame on our own.

To  play the game clone this repo and run the main file.
